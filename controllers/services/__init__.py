"""
Service layer for handling permissions and unified access to various models.

Ensures that the viewer has the necessary permissions to load/edit the requested model(s).

This is based on their role in relevant courses, the ownership of the model, and the visibility of the model.

The following models have permissions handled by this service:
- Course
- Assignment: hidden, ip_address, passcode
- AssignmentGroup
- AssignmentGroupMembership
- Submission
- User

Lower priority models that I may add later:
- Review
- Report
